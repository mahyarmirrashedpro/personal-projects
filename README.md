# Personal Projects

Personal projects, including mini-projects, that I have contributed to and for which I have permission to share publicly are included in this repository. Small descriptions are also included for convenience.

## Extractor

The University of Manitoba chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (UMIEEE) holds many workshops for both chapter members and non-members. However, an issue presented itself where there was no effective manner to analyze the registration information for auditing purposes. `extractor.py`, using Python's `argparse` library allowed to set flags to pull specific basic data points from all registrations or a subset of registrations.

## Stopwatch

Using Verilog, Quartus II Prime Software, and the DE10-Standard FPGA-SoC Development Board, a digital stopwatch with lap view capabilities was implemented. The stopwatch was designed to be accurate to two decimal places.
